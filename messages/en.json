	"klimakrise": "# The Earth is getting hotter \n\n**For around 150 years, mankind has been heating up the planet at an unnaturally fast rate by emitting greenhouse gases. Life on earth cannot adapt quickly enough.** \n\nThere have always been climatic fluctuations throughout the millions of years of Earth's history. Life on Earth has slowly adapted to these changes. But now the Earth's average temperature is rising unnaturally quickly. This climate change is man-made: It is caused by the emission of greenhouse gases that increase the earth's natural greenhouse effect. The earth is heating up. Since industrialization began around 150 years ago, the average temperature has risen by 1 degree. \n\n[![EUROPE-Germany-1881-2022-DW-barslabel.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/zfMZxDcL/EUROPE-Germany-1881-2022-DW-barslabel.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/WDMH3Vjj)\n**Warming Stripes** , Ed Hawkins,  University of Reading, [CC BY 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/) \n\n*British climate researcher Ed Hawkins has the “ Warming Stripes” were invented to simply represent global warming. In them, the mean temperature of a single year is shown as a narrow color strip: dark blue stands for cool, red for warm. When strung together, the strips create an easy-to-understand barcode. Hawkins has now worked with the British Institute for Environmental Analytics to create warming stripes for many countries around the world. Anyone can download them on the [ShowYourStripes](https://showyourstripes.info/c/europe/germany/all) portal. It is based primarily on the data set from the \"Berkeley Earth\" project.* \n\n### Consequences of warming \n\nFor us humans, 1 degree more or less is hardly noticeable. This one degree is already having far-reaching consequences for the earth. It exceeds the adaptability of nature and humans. Weather extremes such as heavy rain, hail, storms, heat waves and long dry seasons are occurring more frequently around the world. While deserts are spreading around the equator, other parts of the world are sinking into the sea due to rising sea levels. Due to severe drought and a lack of rain, there are more droughts and forest fires in many areas. Because animals and plants cannot adapt to rapid climate change, many species are threatened with extinction. And people are also losing their living space: around 3.3 to 3.6 billion people live in regions that could become uninhabitable due to climate change - because they are flooded, do not provide enough food and drinking water or simply become too hot. \n\n### Just one degree more \n\nScientists around the world are researching how the earth's climate is changing. They develop models, so-called climate scenarios. They show how the earth could change - depending on how much CO₂ we humans emit. This means we know that whether the earth warms by 1.5 or 2 degrees has huge effects. \n\n___\n\n# Knowledge and action\n\n**In order to limit global warming, the international community adopted a climate protection agreement in Paris in 2015. However, the Paris climate targets are still a long way off**.\n\nHow many greenhouse gases we emit has a direct impact on global warming. When the first World Climate Conference was held in 1979, countries still had a lot of room for maneuver. Despite this, global CO₂ emissions continued to rise. This is set to change: At the UN Climate Change Conference in Paris in December 2015, 197 countries agreed on a new, global climate protection agreement. This agreement is what is meant when we talk about the 1.5 degree target or the Paris climate targets. It is considered a milestone in climate protection. The countries have committed to limiting global warming to \"well below\" two degrees Celsius compared to the pre-industrial age. They also want to endeavor to limit it to 1.5 degrees. The concrete measures (\"Nationally Determined Contributions\") are determined by the states themselves.\n\n**What has happened so far**\n\nThe actual climate protection measures are not yet sufficient to limit global warming to 2 or even 1.5 degrees. In no country on earth. The earth would be around 3 degrees warmer by 2100 if countries were to maintain their current climate protection measures. This would have fatal consequences for people and the environment. For us too: with global warming of 3 degrees, we can expect around 6 degrees of warming in Germany. This will increase the frequency of hot days, droughts and extreme precipitation. \n\n**The world can still be saved**\n\nThe problem: scientists consider the German government's current climate protection measures to be inadequate. They are not enough to achieve its own climate targets, such as climate neutrality by 2045, and certainly not the Paris climate targets. The \"Climate Action Tracker\" research project describes gaps in building laws and in the entire transport sector. Furthermore, the German government's climate target is not ambitious enough. It is inappropriate that Germany, as one of the richest countries in the world, is not fulfilling its own reporting obligations and is not even implementing simple measures such as a general speed limit on freeways (Climate Action Tracker).\n\n___\n\n **Sources** The earth is getting hotter\n\n- Climate Action Tracker (2023).

	"protest_in_deutschland": "# Protest in Germany \n\n**In a democracy, protest should draw attention to grievances and initiate reforms. It is through protest that a democracy develops. The pressure of protest is necessary to draw politicians' attention to the major issues in our society and to put them under pressure to tackle problems such as climate change more quickly.**\n\nProtest comes in different forms. Even a post on social media can be a low-threshold form of protest. We find protest on the street, at registered demonstrations. Breaking the law, as in civil disobedience, is also an expression of protest. Legal norms are made by people. Protest can shift them. A well-known example of this is the civil rights movement in the USA, which demanded more rights for black people. In doing so, the civil rights activists deliberately violated the legal norms of the time. Today, we see this protest as justified. However, protest can also be violent if it causes suffering to other people.\n\n**Direct, indirect and institutional protest**\n\nAccording to Dr. Simon Teune, the different forms of protest are united by the fact that they are publicly visible and want to express a concern. He is a political sociologist specializing in protest and movement research. Without publicity, protest does not work. Another way to differentiate between forms of protest is to look at where the protest starts: direct, indirect and institutional protest.  In direct protest, the protest works through direct action:  This can be damage to property or damage to the image of the other side. Civil disobedience and strikes are also direct actions. There is also the form that has an indirect effect. These involve making a problem visible in public debates, for example through demonstrations. The third form, institutional, includes petitions and legal proceedings. However, the individual forms do not simply exist side by side; they are often linked in a larger strategy. There is also no clear distinction between the individual protest groups. Anyone who is active in Fridays for Future can also be involved in Ende Gelände's civil disobedience. Just as realistic is the path of \"Fridays for Future\" into politics - from the street to the parliamentary group.  \n\n**Violence as a limit**\n\nBut there are also limits to protest: Behaviors that a group or network cannot consider as possible means of protest. In Germany, it has become established in recent years that violence is one such boundary that must not be crossed during a protest. However, this does not apply to right-wing social movements. Police officers and journalists are then attacked during demonstrations, for example. However, there are also countries that have a much more confrontational protest culture than Germany, such as Greece or France. There, clashes with the police are not scandalized as much as they are in Germany. \n\n___\n\n**Sources**\n\n- Interview mit Dr. Simon Teune (2023).

	"im_diskurs": "# In discourse: climate activism in Germany\n **In recent decades, environmental and climate movements have repeatedly ensured that the issue of climate protection remains present in political discourse. Nevertheless, knowledge and action are still two different building sites in the fight against the climate crisis.**\n\nClimate activism is polarizing in Germany. This was recently demonstrated by the actions of the Last Generation: mashed potatoes on famous paintings, fir trees sprayed orange and blocked roads. According to the ARD Germany Trend, only 13% of those surveyed consider the road blockades to be justified. At the same time, 44 percent are of the opinion that faster changes are needed in climate protection. Nevertheless, the actions are not ineffective; they draw public attention to the climate crisis. The media report and society discusses. Protesters cannot influence what people think about their concerns. However, they can use their protest to stimulate social discourse. Nevertheless, it can happen that the discussion is not about the specific issues, but about the form of action itself. The attention and therefore the discourse shifts.\n\n**A look at history**\n\nIn the past, environmental organizations had little political influence. Climate change was one issue among many others: endangered animal species, waste or nuclear power were more in the foreground. Climate change was not focused enough on Germany. Nature conservation, protecting animals and forests seemed more tangible. In the 1970s, more people joined the environmental movement in Germany. Awareness of global warming increased through scientific research and international climate conferences were held. In addition, the German government planned to expand nuclear energy. During the construction of the new nuclear power plants, citizens protested: They were afraid that their living space could be damaged. During the protests, people also occupied the construction sites, for example in 1975 in Whyl in southern Baden or in 1979 in Gorleben in Lower Saxony. So-called colorful and alternative lists emerged from the citizens' initiatives. Before the 1979 European elections, the lists merged to form the joint electoral alliance \"Sonstige Politischen Vereinigung DIE GRÜNEN\". It wasn't until the 80s and 90s that the climate crisis reached German politics. In 2019, the German government passed the first climate protection law.  \n \n**Justice**\n\nWith the entry into force of climate laws, the issue of justice has also come to the fore. Regulatory measures such as a CO2 tax or the much-discussed \"Heating Act\" can hit poor households harder, depending on how they are designed. At the same time, climate activists are also increasingly concerned with the issue of climate justice. This is because climate change is hitting poor, formerly colonized countries harder globally. At the same time, they have fewer resources to adapt. And in Germany, too, calculations show that the effects of climate change place a greater burden on poor households: they have to insure themselves against extreme weather events and may not be able to afford air conditioning for hot days or a place in the countryside. \n\n**Activists in the media**\n\nExtreme weather situations such as the floods in the Ahr valley make it clear that the climate catastrophe has long since arrived in Germany. The German media can no longer ignore the discourse on climate change. Activists give interviews and sit on panel discussions. This is often limited to a small group of people, such as Luisa Neubauer as the face of Fridays for Future Germany. The personal hype surrounding Greta Thunberg can be seen as one of the reasons why the FFF movement has received so much media attention. \nMass media determine how the climate crisis is reported. They prefer to report on events with a high news value. There are protests in Germany every day. But not every single action is seen. The media often only cover a small part. In the media, we tend to see the big protests, the radical ones or those supported by prominent people.\nSome activists receive encouragement and understanding in the media. In 2020, for example, stern worked with Fridays for Future both in the magazine and digitally for World Climate Day. On the other hand, more conservative media often take a critical and distanced stance towards activists. They particularly criticize the catastrophization and highlight the fear of a supposed radicalization. Some media also go one step further: Last Generation activists are described as \"climate terrorists\" for their actions. In this way, activists are criminalized and defamed for their actions. In 2022, the word was voted \"unword of the year\" by linguists from Marburg.  Today, the climate discourse is not only taking place in newspapers and on the radio. Climate activists can mobilize quickly and with few resources on social media. Campaigns reach people faster and more directly than before Instagram, Facebook and co. Climate activists are moving from the streets to online channels. But their critics can also be found on the internet. \n\n___\n\n**Sources**\n\n- Beil, L. (2023).

	"ziviler_ungehorsam": "# Civil disobedience\n\n**Civil disobedience can take different forms: Blockades, tax refusal, protest camps, church asylum. By deliberately violating legal norms and certain laws, activists want to draw attention to an injustice they perceive.**\n\nThere is no single definition of civil disobedience. The term is just as controversial as the protest itself. Dr. Benjamin Kiesewetter, philosopher and professor at Bielefeld University, has defined civil disobedience as a specific form of political protest that deliberately and out of moral motives transgresses rules and laws in order to draw attention to political grievances. Disobedience is non-violent and typically accepts the free and democratic basic order. Breaking the law is a symbol that appeals to the public.\n\n**Civil disobedience in history**\n\nCivil disobedience can be traced back primarily to the American philosopher Henry David Thoreau (1817-1862). He coined the term \"civil disobedience\" in an essay. In it, he explained that he could no longer pay taxes for reasons of conscience and to protest against the war against Mexico and slavery. The Indian lawyer Mohandas K. (Mahatma) Gandhi (1869-1948) and the American civil rights activist Martin Luther King, Jr. (1929-1968) also practised civil disobedience. In Germany, civil disobedience had its heyday in the mid-1970s with the anti-nuclear movement. In the 1980s, parts of the peace movement organized sit-in blockades in front of federal military facilities. The occupation of Hambach Forest can also be counted as a form of protest. \n\n**The last generation**\n\nIn Germany, the civil disobedience of the Last Generation has been in the news recently. However, groups such as Ende Gelände also choose the action form of civil disobedience. Legally, civil disobedience in itself is not a criminal offense or an administrative offense. In the case of action groups, sanctions are imposed for specific legal violations such as damage to property, coercion or trespassing. The Last Generation would like to persuade the federal government to commit to more climate protection and to implement it. So far, they have accepted fines and prison sentences as consequences for their behavior.  The current debate focuses heavily on the protest actions and where the boundaries of civil disobedience should lie. ___\n\n**Sources**\n\n- Kiesewetter, B. (1992).

	"gewalt_und_repression": "# Repression and violence\n**Protest is uncomfortable. Protest is annoying. Protest has to hurt sometimes. Especially to those against whom it is directed: often governments, authorities, state power. But in a democracy they have to put up with it - within certain limits.**\nThe police have to ensure the safety of protesters when they register a demonstration, for example. For example, they have to divert traffic. This is part of the right of assembly. However, the police do not always help the protesters. With its \"Protect the Protest\" campaign in 2023, the human rights organization Amnesty International warned that police violence against protesters also occurs in Germany. For example, so-called pain grips on protesters during climate blockades. Nevertheless, according to the \"Last Generation\", police violence is an exception at their protest actions. Pain grips are no longer used as frequently as they were in the beginning. Amnesty International has also called for the preventive detention of climate activists. Preventive detention is used by the police to prevent a criminal offense. However, Amnesty International criticizes that the measure is used for deterrence purposes. Activists from the \"Last Generation\" in Bavaria were particularly affected. Germany's treatment of protesters has been under scrutiny for some time. The organization Reporters Without Borders also downgraded Germany in its international press freedom rankings after a journalist was killed in an accident during the sometimes violent evacuation of Hambach Forest in 2018. Environmental journalists themselves are regularly excluded from such places or criminalized.\n**Rejection on the street and online**\nCitizens can also suppress protest - or at least try to. For example, the Fridays for Future protests were initially met with a lot of rejection, with counter-initiatives such as the loose group \"Hubraum for Future\". Today, for example, many reject the protest actions of the \"Last Generation\". Some take their anger at the road blockades out on the protesters, for example by insulting them or even making death threats - on the street and online. You can also see videos of people kicking or dragging protesters away. The number of posts showing aggressive passers-by or drivers is increasing, while the inhibition threshold for vigilante justice against climate activists is falling. However, those who use physical violence against climate activists are in the minority.\n**Bodily harm, coercion or insults**\nHow often protesters experience violence is not recorded centrally. In response to stern's inquiries to police authorities, state criminal investigation offices, state interior ministries and public prosecutors' offices throughout Germany, officials have registered more than 150 cases of violence against climate activists in Germany (as of September 2023). There have been a particularly high number of cases in Berlin (98), Bavaria (13), Saxony-Anhalt (11) and Saxony (11). Assault, coercion and insults were reported the most. In many cases, protest groups share their injury figures in press releases, but do not file criminal charges - for fear of criminalization or rejection by the police. However, the figures have not yet been collected or compiled separately. They come from the police crime statistics (PKS) and data on political crime from the Federal Criminal Police Office, and the threat to climate activists is also increasing on the internet. Many of them experience hate speech - especially if they are young and female. However, hate speech is only one part of an often larger strategy: defamation, disinformation, threats and incitement to violence are all part of it. ___\n**Sources**\n\n- Alexy, L., Fisahn, A., Hähnchen, S., Mushoff, T. & Trepte, U.

	"soziale_kipppunkte": "# What does activism achieve?\n**Protest can trigger or reinforce social change. But does it also work when it is met with rejection?**\nMajor social and political changes are often accompanied and reinforced by protest. Climate protests and activism could trigger the \"rapid, disruptive and transformative changes\" that the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) calls for to tackle the climate crisis. Politically, little has changed since the founding of protest groups such as Fridays for Future or Extinction Rebellion. However, most sociologists and psychologists agree that climate protests are drawing society's attention to the climate crisis. Today, the vast majority of Germans clearly feel the negative consequences of the climate crisis and consider adaptation measures to be necessary. This is shown, for example, by the Environmental Awareness Study 2022. This awareness has risen sharply in recent years. Other studies suggest that activism has played a large part in this change - even if some forms of protest are unpopular.\n **Are social tipping points saving our climate?**\nThe popularity of protest groups is often overstated. Activists are not politicians - their aim is not to win majorities. Nevertheless, they can bring about change or at least contribute to it. Psychological and sociological studies show that a few people can quickly bring about major changes. Some analyses already see social upheaval when ten percent swim against the tide. Others assume up to 40 percent. Researchers agree that even a certain \"critical mass\" can set the ball rolling. Research is increasingly focusing on \"social tipping points\" - factors that quickly bring about fundamental social change. The principle: a minority of people trigger something that spreads exponentially. For example, researchers believe a tipping point is reached when fossil fuels become unattractive as an investment. If a critical mass of investors withdraw their money from such investments, the majority would soon follow. Social norms and values are also an important tipping point. We can reach one here if the majority of us recognize the ethical problems of fossil fuels and demand change. Some researchers see movements such as Fridays For Future, Extinction Rebellion or the Last Generation as a sign that social norms and values are already changing.\n___\n**Sources**\n\n- Bundesministerium für Umwelt, Naturschutz, nukleare Sicherheit und Verbraucherschutz (BMUV) und Umweltbundesamt (UBA) (2022).

	"fridays_for_future": "# Fridays for Future\n**Worldwide movement**\nFridays for Future (FFF for short) is a global movement of pupils, students and other young people for climate justice. The group is represented in many countries and is organized internationally as well as nationally and locally. The movement's central goal is to meet the 1.5-degree target agreed at the 2015 World Climate Conference in Paris. In Germany, Fridays for Future is organized on a grassroots basis and has no elected representatives. The activists are calling on the German government to phase out coal by 2030 as well as net-zero emissions and a 100% renewable energy supply by 2035. The movement and its demands are supported by numerous groups such as Parents for Future and Scientists for Future. \n**Demonstrations and cooperation**\nFFF became known for its school strikes. Following the example of Swedish initiator Greta Thunberg, young people have been leaving school on Fridays since 2018 to demonstrate for climate justice. The Global Climate Strike, which the movement has organized twice a year since 2019, is regularly joined by millions of people worldwide. FFF is now considered a cooperative climate movement. In Germany, activists regularly work together with trade unions and other civil society actors and have held talks with politicians on several occasions.\n**Constitutional complaint for more climate protection**\nA constitutional complaint by German activists, which became known as the \"climate lawsuit\", caused a particular stir: in 2020, several young people filed a lawsuit against the climate law of the then federal government. The Federal Constitutional Court ruled in their favor in 2021: Climate protection is a human right. With its decision, the Federal Climate Protection Act of 2019 was declared unconstitutional in large parts and had to be amended accordingly. The federal government then had to present tighter emission reduction targets.\n___\n**Sources\n\n- Fridays for Future Deutschland (2024).

	"letzte_generation": "# Last generation\n**Comply with our own laws**\nThe Last Generation protest group believes that we only have two to three years left to stop the climate crisis. To this end, it is demanding clear measures from the German government, such as a fair phase-out of oil, gas and coal by 2030 at the latest. The group is calling on the government to respect its own laws. It refers, for example, to the Paris Climate Agreement, which commits to limiting global warming to well below two degrees, and to Article 20a of the German Basic Law: \"The state shall also protect the natural foundations of life (...) in responsibility for future generations\".\n**Non-violent civil disobedience**\nThe activists of the Last Generation use civil disobedience as a form of protest. With their actions, they want to disrupt the everyday lives of as many people as possible in order to draw attention to the urgency of the climate crisis. The activists often organize road blockades to stop traffic. The protesters consciously accept the risk of being punished for their actions. This can include fines or, in a few cases, prison sentences. It is important to them that their protest remains non-violent. From March 2024, however, the Last Generation activists no longer want to stick to the streets. Instead, the group wants to call for disobedient assemblies. They want to confront those responsible for climate destruction more directly.\n**Hunger strike 2021\nThe Last Generation was born out of a hunger strike. Initially seven, then six young activists went hungry near the Reichstag in Berlin in August 2021. They demanded a one-hour meeting with the three candidates for the office of Federal Chancellor and the establishment of a climate council made up of citizens. After 27 days, the last two strikers ended their action. The desired talks did not take place. Olaf Scholz only sat down with two of the activists after the election in Berlin. At that time, the movement was primarily concerned with preventing food waste and an agricultural turnaround by 2030.  ___\n**Sources\n\n- Letzte Generation. (2023a).

	"extinction_rebellion": "# Extinction Rebellion\n**Against extinction**\nThe \"Extinction Rebellion\" (XR) movement, which translates as \"rebellion against extinction\", originated in England. Today it exists in many countries. It has also been holding protests in Germany since 2019. According to its own information, there are over 1,000 groups in almost 90 countries worldwide. In addition to actions of civil disobedience, the activists rely on actions that are reminiscent of performance art. In 2020, for example, they colored the Spree green. The group describes its own protest as creative, artistic and non-violent. XR organizes itself decentrally in Germany and does not want to have a leader. The German section of XR has distanced itself from the mastermind and co-founder of the movement, British environmental activist Roger Hallam. He had trivialized the Holocaust in an interview.\n**The demands**XR wants the German government to recognize the existential threat posed by the climate crisis and name it as such. It also demands that the emission of all fossil greenhouse gases be stopped and that further emissions be massively reduced. The movement's third major demand is a citizens' council. In it, randomly selected citizens are to discuss measures against the ecological catastrophe and for climate justice. Like the Last Generation, XR also offers training and tutorials to prepare its activists.\n**Blockades in Berlin 2019**\nIn October 2019, the movement wanted to disrupt the normal course of events in the city to make people aware of the climate crisis. Activists occupied central locations such as Potsdamer Platz and various streets and bridges. The action was reported in the media, but the hoped-for reaction from politicians failed to materialize. Extinction Rebellion had previously written an open letter to the Chancellery with the group's demands. It was also supported by well-known personalities such as actor Christian Ulmen, actress Anna Loos and musician Bela B.  ___\n**Sources\n\n- Stöber, S. (2020).

	"ende_gelaende": "# Ende Gelände\n**Against coal and capitalism**\nEnde Gelände is the name of a Europe-wide action alliance that has been organizing regular mass protests and blockades since 2015, primarily in German lignite mining areas. According to its own statements, the group consists of \"people from the anti-nuclear and anti-coal movements, from the preparatory groups of the climate camps in the Rhineland and Lusatia, from the forest occupation in Hambach Forest, from grassroots climate policy initiatives and citizens' initiatives, but also from larger environmental organizations [and] left-wing political groups\". The movement demands an immediate coal phase-out and socio-ecological change - it is considered critical of capitalism. Ende Gelände is organized in local and working groups (AGs) such as an action AG, awareness AG or camp AG.\n**Blockades and camps**\nEnde Gelände activists use non-violent methods of civil disobedience to take action against what they define as an unjust situation. Ende Gelände is best known for the large-scale blockades of opencast mines and lignite mining areas that it has regularly organized since 2015. The group also took action around the eviction of Hambach Forest in the fall of 2018 and the eviction of the village of Lützerath at the end of 2022.\n**Prosecution**\nIn 2019, Ende Gelände called for a blockade of the Garzweiler opencast mine in the Rhineland. From June 21, activists blocked the tracks of the coal railroad and the opencast mine itself, forcing RWE to partially halt operations. Following the eviction by the police, activists reported in the group's press releases and to the media that the police had used batons and pepper spray and injured participants in the protests. The police, for their part, reported that police officers had been injured. After the blockade, investigations were launched against several activists, including for trespassing and prisoner liberation.\n___\n**Sources**\n\n- Ende Gelände (2024).

	"gruene_jugend": "# Green Youth\n**Critical youth organization**\nThe Green Youth is the youth organization of the Bündnis 90/Die Grünen party. It has existed since 1994, at that time under the name Grün-Alternatives-Jugendbündnis. In 2000, the organization changed its name to Green Youth and became the party's official youth organization in 2001. The Green Youth describes itself as an autonomous and independent association that also criticizes the party. The youth organization currently has around 16,000 members and is led by two federal spokespersons. These are currently (January 2024) Svenja Appuhn & Katharina Stolla. Membership is possible until the 28th birthday. The organization is organized in local groups, state associations and a federal association. Its headquarters are in Berlin.\n**Expansion of public transport and compliance with the 1.5 degree target**\nThe Green Youth is traditionally left-leaning. Its members campaign for their goals as activists both in party offices and on the streets at demonstrations. When it comes to climate protection, they criticize the fact that politicians are still protecting the interests of large corporations. They are also calling for a social turnaround in mobility, i.e. the expansion of local public transport and improved working conditions for its employees. They continue to demand compliance with the 1.5 degree target.\n**Conflicts with Bündnis 90/The Greens**\nIn terms of content, the Green Youth and the Bündnis 90/Die Grünen party are currently far apart. In the traffic light coalition, the party voted in favor of stricter migration rules and longer operating times for nuclear power plants, among other things. This means that the party does not fulfill the ideals of the Green Youth.  ___\n**Sources**\n\n- Neuroth, O. (2023).

	"content_intro": "# ON THE STREET\n**Welcome, dear visitor! \nHow far can protest go? Germany is arguing about this in talk shows, in feature articles and on the streets. We all know that we are not doing enough to curb the climate crisis. But we disagree on what climate activists are allowed to do to remind us of this. Is it going too far when people block roads or airports? Are they allowed to occupy trees and houses? Or skip school?\nThe exhibition **\"On the streets \"** takes up these questions and forms a new one from them: How far must protest go to initiate social change? It invites you to take to the streets yourself, to get to know climate activists and their world of action, and to find your own form of protest."
